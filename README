Python implementation of the Par Lab health application, targeted at ASP for
specialization and auto-tuning.

This project depends on ASP (http://github.com/shoaibkamil/asp). Since we
potentially may need to modify ASP for the health application, this project is
actually a fork of ASP, although it contains files specific to the health
application.
